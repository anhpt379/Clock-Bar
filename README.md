### Why
The upper right corner seems the farthest place on the planet to look at. Full of menu items, but an area you really find it inconvenient. Touch bar has been so convenient for so many things that you want to have everything right there. Having the clock right on the touch bar save you from visiting the darkest corner and saves so much effort. Seriously!!! You will realise. ~ Nihal

Or, simply because you like to work full-screen while the menu bar is hidden, but want to have a glanceable clock somewhere. ~ Jelmer
